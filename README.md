# WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript

This is a boilerplate project that uses WebdriverIO v5 and TypeScript v3. This project is useful not only as an example of WebdriverIO v5 and TypeScript playing nicely together, but it includes examples of the PageObject pattern and some practical examples for using WebdriverIO to build an automated test suite with Mocha & Chai.

## Getting Started
```
git clone git@github.com:jpolley/WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript.git
cd WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript
npm install
npm test
```

## Why TypeScript
TypeScript offers the benefit of types, but you won't find them in this project. I have found TypeScript to be great because of the IDE intellisense and support for the latest JavaScript features: 

![intellisense](https://github.com/jpolley/WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript/blob/master/src/assets/intellisense.png)

You no longer need to explicitly compile your TypeScript to JavaScript using the command `tsc`. This project uses ts-node/register and tsconfig-paths as detailed on the [WebdriverIO TypeScript setup](https://webdriver.io/docs/typescript.html) page. 

## Page Objects

[Page Objects](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) are a really nifty abstraction for the UI elements that you interact with in your tests. You can create simple getter functions for each element that you need to access. And optionally you can create convenience methods like `loginWithCredentials()` that allow you to write more concise tests. 

##### `src/pages/LoginPage.ts`

```typescript
import BasePage from 'src/pages/BasePage';

class LoginPage extends BasePage {

    get username() {
        return $('#username');
    }

    get password() {
        return $('#password');
    }

    get submit() {
        return $('#login > button');
    }

    loginWithCredentials(username, password) {
        this.username.setValue(username);
        this.password.setValue(password);
        this.submit.click();
    }
}

export default new LoginPage();
```

##### `test/login.spec.ts`


```typescript
import {expect} from 'chai';
import LoginPage from 'src/pages/LogInPage';

describe('Login page', () => {
    it('should allow access with correct credentials', () => {
        LoginPage.open;
        LoginPage.loginWithCredentials('tomsmith', 'SuperSecretPassword!');
        
        expect(LoginPage.flash).to.include('You logged into a secure area!');
    });
});
```

## Examples
The tests in this project use [http://the-internet.herokuapp.com](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com) to demonstrate how to interact with some of the most common UI elements you will encounter. Including: dropdowns, basic auth, dynamic loading (waitUntil), file uploads, and javascript alerts. The [official documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/api.html) already covers most of these but it never hurts to see a practical example wired up and working. 

## CI examples

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jpolley/WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/jpolley/WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript/tree/master) CircleCI was pretty easy to setup and you can check out `.circleci/config.yml` if you are curious. 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jpolley/WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript.svg?branch=travisci)](https://travis-ci.org/jpolley/WebdriverIO_v5_TypeScript) Travis CI took a little more effort and I was only able to get it running in headless mode so I left those changes in another branch named "travisci" instead of merging them to master.
